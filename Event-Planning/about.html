        <p class="meet-employees__info">
            Sarah Glick and Chelsea LaFollette are the magic makers at Brilliant Event Planning. They believe there is
            something to celebrate in every moment. Chelsea is the lead planner in the New York City office, while Sarah
            is the lead Boston wedding planner. Though based in two locations, they often team up to create
            <a href="https://brillianteventplanning.com/weddings" target="_blank">weddings</a> and
            <a href=https://brillianteventplanning.com/events" target="_blank">events</a> together.

                    <figcaption class="meet-employees-list__item-caption">
                        Sarah's favorite part of wedding day is the first dance, but not because of the newlyweds! It's
                        the moment when the grandparents join in for that first slow song.
                        <br><br>
                        The team fondly calls her SG (even though technically she's SR now) and she's the team's smile
                        instigator. She started freelancing for Brilliant after graduating with a degree in Psychology
                        from McGill University in Montreal. She fell in love with weddings and never left. Now she
                        co-owns the company with Chelsea.
                        <br><br>
                        When she's not planning weddings, she can be found hiking mountains with her husband, giggling
                        and exploring with her baby boy, traveling, listening to crime podcasts, attending Pure Barre
                        classes, snuggling with her fat cat Pip, and munching on chocolate chip cookies.
                        <br><br>
                        You can follow Sarah behind the scenes in our stories, signed “SG”.

                        Chelsea's favorite part of wedding day is when the father of the bride tears up at the sight of
                        his daughter in her wedding dress - it gets her every time!
                        <br><br>
                        Chelsea got her start in weddings after completing her first year of law school. She realized
                        she wanted a career that made her excited to go to work every day. After managing the operations
                        and expansion of a gourmet food company, she joined Sarah's team at Brilliant and never looked
                        back!
                        <br><br>
                        When she's not planning events, Chelsea can be found in her kitchen creating something
                        delicious. Other interests include snuggling her baby girl, raiding home decor stores, searching
                        for the stinkiest cheese, and traveling with her husband.
